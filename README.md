# MernChat App

Our app offers some great features:

Sign In and Sign Up: Easily create an account and add a profile picture.

Connect with Others: Find users, get notifications, and see when someone is typing.

Chat Options: Chat one-on-one or in groups. You can also add or remove people from group chats. We use JWT Authentication to keep things secure.

Technology Used: We've used ReactJS for the frontend, ExpressJs for the backend, and styled everything with the user-friendly Chakra UI library.

Data Management: We store data in MongoDB with Atlas for reliable access.

Easy Navigation: Move around the app smoothly thanks to React Router Dom V6.
